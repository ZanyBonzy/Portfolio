### Introductions

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my page. 

I'm ZanyBonzy. A highly skilled and knowledgeable Security Researcher with a proven track record of conducting in-depth research, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing solutions to enhance smart contract security. With over 80 confirmed high and medium severity vulnerabilities in public & private contests, and countless lows, be rest assured that no codebase is too difficult for me to break, except the ones I don't audit.
Organizations I've worked with include Code4rena, Sherlock Audits, CodeHawks, Pashov Audit Group, Cantina, Secure3, Immunefi etc.

### Stack

I audit contracts written in solidity or vyper for EVM based chains. I also work on rust based smart contracts for Substrate, Cosmowasm and Solana based systems. For starknet based contracts, I have a good knowledge of cairo.

### Highlights

1. [Balance doubling bug](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-acala-findings/issues/16) in Acala's ORML rewards library.
> Users can transfer their shares to themselves and effectively double their token balance;
2. Griefing [attack](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-traitforge-findings/issues/227) on users' minting rewards in TraitForge's NFT.
> Seller's airdrop benefits can be maliciously reduced by malicious buyers for little or no cost.
3. Permanent [bricking](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-olas-findings/issues/78) of Olas protocol's VoteWeighting contract.
> The contract's Curve type slope calculation was not correctly updated when removing a nominee
